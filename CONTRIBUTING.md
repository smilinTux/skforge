# Contributing to Forgeprint 🔧

First off — **thank you**. You're helping build something that makes software free for everyone.

## Ways to Contribute

### 🆕 Add a New Blueprint Category

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a new directory under `blueprints/your-category/`
3. Follow the [Blueprint Template](./blueprints/TEMPLATE/)
4. Research top 10 OSS + proprietary products in the category
5. Build an exhaustive feature list (aim for 50-100 features)
6. Write architecture patterns, test specs, and memory profiles
7. Submit a PR

### ✅ Add Features to Existing Blueprints

Found a feature we missed? Open a PR adding it to the category's `features.yml`. Include:
- Feature name
- Description (1-2 sentences)
- Complexity (low/medium/high)
- Dependencies (other features it requires)
- Which products implement it (reference)

### 🧪 Improve Test Specifications

Better tests = better generated software. Help us by:
- Adding edge case test specs
- Improving benchmark baselines
- Adding integration test scenarios

### 📝 Improve Documentation

- Fix typos, clarify descriptions
- Add architectural diagrams
- Write tutorials or guides
- Translate blueprints

### 🐛 Report Issues

- Missing features in a category
- Incorrect architectural guidance
- Test specs that don't cover important cases
- Suggestions for new categories

## Quality Standards

- **Be exhaustive**: More detail = better AI output
- **Be specific**: Vague specs produce vague code
- **Be tested**: Every feature needs test criteria
- **Be language-agnostic**: Blueprints should work for any target language
- **Be honest**: If a feature is complex, say so

## Code of Conduct

Be excellent to each other. We're building something for everyone — act like it.
