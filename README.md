# 🔧 SKForge

### Don't use software. Forge your own.

**AI-native software blueprints that generate complete, production-ready software in any language.**

Pick your category. Choose your features. Select your language. Let AI build it.

**Free. Forever.** A [smilinTux](https://github.com/smilinTux) Open Source Project by S&K Holdings QT.

## 🐧 What is SKForge?

SKForge provides **detailed, structured specification files** (blueprints) that any LLM — even mid-tier models — can consume to generate complete, working, tested software products.

Think of it as **"Skills for Software"** — instead of teaching an AI how to use a tool, you give it the recipe to **build the tool from scratch**.

### The Problem

- Developers waste months reinventing load balancers, web servers, auth systems, message queues
- AI can code, but needs structured guidance to produce production-grade software
- Enterprise software is bloated — 90% of features go unused
- Open source projects are complex — hard to customize without deep expertise

### The Solution

```
📋 Pick a blueprint     →  Load Balancer, Database, API Gateway...
✅ Choose your features  →  TLS? Rate limiting? WebSocket? You decide.
🦀 Select your language  →  Rust, Go, Python, Java, .NET, Zig...
🔨 Forge it             →  AI reads specs → builds → tests → ships
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Pick a Blueprint

Browse the [`blueprints/`](./blueprints) directory for your software category.

### 2. Create Your `driver.md`

```markdown
# driver.md — My Custom Load Balancer

## Blueprint
category: load-balancers

## Language
target: rust

## Features
- [x] HTTP/1.1 & HTTP/2
- [x] Health checks
- [x] Round-robin balancing
- [x] TLS termination
- [x] Rate limiting
- [x] Prometheus metrics
- [ ] gRPC support          # Don't need this
- [ ] WebSocket support     # Skip for now
```

### 3. Feed to Any LLM

```
"Read this driver.md and the referenced blueprint specs.
Generate a complete implementation that passes all specified tests."
```

### 4. Get Production-Ready Code

The AI generates complete source code with:
- ✅ All selected features implemented
- ✅ Unit tests passing
- ✅ Integration tests passing
- ✅ Benchmarks meeting baseline targets
- ✅ Documentation generated

## 🏗️ How Blueprints Work

Each blueprint contains:

```
blueprints/load-balancers/
├── BLUEPRINT.md           # Master architectural specification
├── features.yml           # Exhaustive feature catalog (pick & choose)
├── architecture.md        # System design patterns & data flows
├── tests/
│   ├── unit-tests.md      # Required unit test specifications
│   ├── integration-tests.md
│   └── benchmarks.md      # Performance baselines
├── memory-profiles/
│   ├── embedded.md        # IoT/embedded (< 64MB RAM)
│   ├── standard.md        # Server (1-8GB RAM)
│   └── enterprise.md      # High-memory (8GB+ RAM)
├── deployment/
│   ├── docker.md
│   ├── kubernetes.md
│   └── bare-metal.md
└── references/
    ├── opensource-top10.md # Top 10 OSS products analyzed
    └── proprietary-top10.md
```

## 🏗️ Stack Composer — Forge Your Entire Stack

Why build one component when you can forge the whole thing?

```bash
# Preview a pre-built stack template
forge stack ai-platform

# Templates available:
#   saas-starter    — Gateway + Web + DB + Cache + Queue
#   ai-platform     — Gateway + DB + Vectors + Graph + Queue + Storage
#   enterprise      — Full 9-layer production stack
#   notion-killer   — Gateway + Web + DB + Search + Storage + Realtime
#   zero-trust      — Gateway + Secrets + DB + Vectors + Graph + Storage

# Or define your own stack.yml
forge stack my-stack.yml
```

Pick one blueprint per layer. Define how they connect. Generate the entire integrated stack — database, cache, search, API gateway, auth, deployment configs — in one command. See **[STACKS.md](./STACKS.md)** for full documentation.

## 🔍 RECON — Create Blueprints for ANY Software

Want to blueprint a new software category? We wrote the guide:

**[RECON.md](./RECON.md)** — The Recipe for Making Recipes

Any AI (or human) can follow this step-by-step process to:
1. Research the top 30 products (OSS + proprietary + SaaS)
2. Extract every feature into a master catalog
3. Document the architecture patterns
4. Write test specifications
5. Create memory/hardware profiles

**It's reverse engineering without copying code.** We document patterns, not source. The AI writes fresh code from the specs. Royalty-free. 100% legal.

> *Copy-paste the quick-start prompt from RECON.md into any AI and point it at a software category. Instant blueprint.*

---

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions! Here's how:

- **New Blueprints:** Follow [RECON.md](./RECON.md) to research and blueprint any software category
- **New Features:** Add features to existing `features.yml` files
- **New Categories:** Create a new blueprint directory following the template
- **Improvements:** Enhance architectural guidance, test specs, or memory profiles
- **Translations:** Help make blueprints accessible in more languages

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

## 📜 License

**Dual License — Anti-Predator + User Freedom:**

- **Forge CLI & Tooling:** [AGPL-3.0](./LICENSE) — Ensures the forge stays free forever. If you modify it and run it as a service, you MUST share your changes. Protects against corporate capture.
- **Blueprints (generated code):** Apache 2.0 — The software YOU generate from our blueprints is YOURS. No strings. Commercial, personal, nonprofit — do whatever you want.

*Why?* We want to protect the ecosystem from legal predators while giving YOU maximum freedom with your generated code.

---

## 🌍 Philosophy

> **"We don't sell software. We give everyone the blueprints to build their own."**

Software companies charge millions for products built from the same patterns. Those patterns can be documented, cataloged, and handed to AI to rebuild from scratch — custom, lean, no bloat, no vendor lock-in.

As AI models improve, the same blueprints produce better software. **Future-proof by design.**

## 🏠 Self-Host Everything

SKForge is built for the **self-hosting revolution**. Every blueprint generates software you own, run, and control — on your hardware, your terms, your rules.

No more:
- 📉 Price hikes you can't control
- 🔒 Vendor lock-in you can't escape
- 📊 Data harvesting you didn't consent to
- 💀 Services sunsetting and killing your workflow

**Your infrastructure. Your data. Your software. Forged by you.**

> *"The cloud is just someone else's computer. Forge your own."*
