## What This Is

SKForge blueprints are **architectural specifications** — not source code copies. We document:
- ✅ What features exist across all products in a category
- ✅ How those features work architecturally
- ✅ What tests validate correct implementation
- ✅ What performance targets to hit
- ❌ NOT: proprietary source code, trade secrets, or patented algorithms

This is legal. This is ethical. This is how engineering has always worked — study the best, document the patterns, build your own.

## 🤖 AI Recon Instructions

**If you are an AI agent tasked with creating a SKForge blueprint, follow these steps exactly.**

### Phase 1: Market Research (30 min)

#### Step 1.1: Identify the Category
Define what this software category IS in 2-3 sentences. What problem does it solve? Who uses it?

```
Example: "A load balancer distributes incoming network traffic across multiple 
backend servers to ensure no single server bears too much demand. Used by any 
application serving more than one server's worth of traffic."
```

#### Step 1.2: Find Top 10 Open Source Products
Search for: `"best open source [category]" site:github.com OR site:reddit.com`

For each product, document:
| Field | What to capture |
|-------|----------------|
| Name | Product name |
| Language | Primary implementation language |
| GitHub Stars | Approximate (indicates adoption) |
| License | OSS license type |
| Key Differentiator | What makes THIS one unique (1 sentence) |
| Architecture | Event-driven? Threaded? Actor model? |
| First Release | Year (indicates maturity) |

#### Step 1.3: Find Top 10 Proprietary/Commercial Products
Search for: `"best [category] enterprise" OR "top [category] vendors" OR "Gartner [category]"`

For each product, document:
| Field | What to capture |
|-------|----------------|
| Name | Product name |
| Vendor | Company |
| Pricing Model | Per-seat, per-use, license, subscription |
| Key Differentiator | What justifies the price tag |
| Notable Features | Features not found in OSS alternatives |

#### Step 1.4: Find Top 10 SaaS Providers
Search for: `"[category] as a service" OR "managed [category]" OR "[category] SaaS"`

For each provider, document:
| Field | What to capture |
|-------|----------------|
| Name | Service name |
| Provider | Company (AWS, GCP, etc.) |
| Pricing | Monthly cost range |
| Lock-in Risk | How hard is it to migrate away? |
| Unique Features | What does the SaaS add over self-hosted? |

**Why SaaS matters:** Every SaaS feature we document is a subscription we can help users CANCEL by forging their own.

### Phase 2: Feature Extraction (45 min)

This is the CORE of the blueprint. Be exhaustive.

#### Step 2.1: Feature Mining Process

For EACH of the 30 products identified:
1. Read the product's documentation / feature page
2. Read the product's configuration reference (this reveals ALL options)
3. Read the product's changelog (last 2 years — shows recently added features)
4. Read comparison articles: `"[product A] vs [product B] features"`
5. Read the product's GitHub issues with label `"feature request"` (shows what's missing)

#### Step 2.2: Feature Cataloging

Create a MASTER feature list combining ALL features from ALL 30 products.

For each feature:
```yaml
- name: Human-readable feature name
  description: |
    1-3 sentences explaining what this feature does and why someone 
    would want it. Be specific enough that an AI could implement it.
  complexity: low | medium | high
    # low = < 1 day to implement
    # medium = 1-5 days
    # high = 1-4 weeks
  default: true | false
    # true = most implementations include this
    # false = advanced/optional feature
  dependencies:
    - List of other features this requires
  found_in:
    - List of products that implement this feature
  saas_replacement: |
    Which SaaS subscription does this feature replace?
    e.g., "Replaces Datadog APM ($23/host/mo)"
```

#### Step 2.3: Feature Grouping

Organize features into logical groups. Common groups:
- **Core** — Fundamental features every implementation needs
- **Security** — Authentication, authorization, encryption, audit
- **Performance** — Caching, optimization, compression, pooling
- **Observability** — Metrics, logging, tracing, health checks
- **Networking/Protocols** — Protocol support, connection handling
- **Storage/Data** — Data management, persistence, replication
- **Operational** — Deployment, configuration, upgrades, scaling
- **Integration** — APIs, webhooks, plugins, extensions
- **Developer Experience** — CLI, SDK, documentation, dashboard

**Target: 60-100 features per category.** If you have fewer than 50, you haven't dug deep enough.

---

### Phase 3: Architecture Analysis (45 min)

#### Step 3.1: Core Architecture Patterns

Research how the top implementations are built. Document:

1. **Data Flow** — How does data enter, get processed, and exit the system?
   ```
   Draw ASCII diagrams:
   
   Client → [Listener] → [Parser] → [Router] → [Handler] → [Backend] → Response
   ```

2. **Concurrency Model** — How does it handle multiple simultaneous operations?
   - Event loop (single-threaded, non-blocking)
   - Thread-per-connection
   - Thread pool + work stealing
   - Actor model
   - Process-per-worker (prefork)
   - Hybrid approaches

3. **State Management** — What state does the system maintain?
   - Connection state
   - Session state
   - Configuration state
   - Cluster state
   - Cache state

4. **Storage Architecture** (if applicable)
   - In-memory vs on-disk
   - B-tree vs LSM-tree vs heap
   - WAL (write-ahead logging)
   - Snapshotting / checkpointing

5. **Configuration Model**
   - File-based (YAML, TOML, JSON)
   - API-driven
   - Environment variables
   - Hot-reload capable?

#### Step 3.2: Extension Points

Document how the software can be extended:
- Plugin/middleware system
- Hook/callback points  
- Custom scripting (Lua, WASM, etc.)
- API for external integrations

#### Step 3.3: Security Architecture

Document security patterns specific to this category:
- Authentication mechanisms
- Authorization models (RBAC, ABAC, ACL)
- Encryption (at rest, in transit)
- Audit logging
- Input validation / injection prevention

---

### Phase 4: Test Specification (30 min)

#### Step 4.1: Unit Test Specifications

For each feature group, define tests that MUST pass:

```markdown
### [Feature Group Name] Tests

#### Test: [Descriptive test name]
- **Purpose:** What does this test verify?
- **Setup:** What preconditions are needed?
- **Input:** What data/request is sent?
- **Expected Output:** What should happen?
- **Edge Cases:**
  - What if input is empty?
  - What if input is malformed?
  - What if system is under load?
  - What if a dependency is unavailable?
```

**Target: 5-10 tests per feature group, 50-100 total tests.**

#### Step 4.2: Integration Test Specifications

Tests that verify features working together:
- End-to-end workflows
- Multi-component interactions
- Failure and recovery scenarios
- Upgrade/migration scenarios

#### Step 4.3: Benchmark Specifications

Define performance baselines:

```markdown
### Benchmark: [Name]
- **Metric:** requests/sec | messages/sec | queries/sec | latency
- **Baseline (minimal features):** [target number]
- **Baseline (standard features):** [target number]
- **Baseline (full features):** [target number]
- **Measurement Method:** How to measure (tool, duration, warmup)
- **Hardware Reference:** What hardware these numbers assume
```

---

### Phase 5: Memory & Hardware Profiles (15 min)

#### Step 5.1: Memory Management Guide

Document how the best implementations manage memory:

- **Buffer Management** — How buffers are allocated, pooled, and freed
- **Connection Memory** — Per-connection memory overhead
- **Cache Memory** — How much memory for caching, eviction policies
- **Working Memory** — Memory needed for processing operations
- **Memory Limits** — How to cap total memory usage
- **Backpressure** — What happens when memory is exhausted

#### Step 5.2: Hardware Profiles

Provide guidance for different deployment targets:

| Profile | RAM | CPU | Disk | Use Case |
|---------|-----|-----|------|----------|
| Embedded | < 256MB | 1 core | < 1GB | IoT, edge devices |
| Small | 512MB-2GB | 1-2 cores | 10GB | Dev, small projects |
| Standard | 4-16GB | 4-8 cores | 100GB | Production server |
| Enterprise | 32-128GB | 16-64 cores | 1TB+ | High-traffic production |

## 🎯 Quick-Start Prompt for AI Agents

Copy this prompt to any AI to start a new blueprint:

```
You are creating a SKForge blueprint for [CATEGORY NAME].

SKForge blueprints are AI-native software specifications — detailed enough 
that a mid-tier LLM can generate a complete, working, tested implementation 
from them.

Follow the RECON methodology:

1. RESEARCH: Find top 10 open source, top 10 proprietary, and top 10 SaaS 
   products in this category. Document name, language, key differentiator.

2. FEATURES: Extract ALL features from ALL 30 products into one master 
   features.yml. Aim for 60-100 features. Group by: Core, Security, 
   Performance, Observability, Operational, Integration.

3. ARCHITECTURE: Document data flow (ASCII diagrams), concurrency models, 
   state management, storage patterns, configuration models, extension points.

4. TESTS: Write unit test specs (50+ tests) and benchmark specs (5+ benchmarks 
   with numeric baselines).

5. MEMORY: Document buffer management, connection overhead, cache sizing, 
   memory limits, and backpressure mechanisms.

Output as markdown files following the SKForge blueprint structure.
All specifications must be detailed enough for GPT-3.5 to implement.
No proprietary code — only patterns and architectural specifications.
```

## ⚖️ Legal & Ethical Notes

### What We Do (Legal)
- Study publicly available documentation, feature lists, and architecture guides
- Document common software patterns that are well-known in the industry
- Create original specifications based on observed patterns
- Generate new code from those specifications

### What We Don't Do (Would Be Illegal)
- Copy proprietary source code
- Reverse-engineer compiled binaries (in jurisdictions where prohibited)
- Violate patents (we document patterns, not patented algorithms)
- Scrape or redistribute copyrighted documentation

### Why This Is Fine
Software patterns are not copyrightable. You can't copyright "a B-tree index" or "round-robin load balancing" or "JWT authentication." These are common engineering knowledge.

What IS copyrightable is specific source code. We never copy that. We document the pattern, and the AI writes NEW code implementing that pattern.

This is exactly how every software engineer has always learned and built — study existing solutions, understand the patterns, build your own. We're just making it systematic and AI-accessible.
