# 🛡️ SAFETY.md — Automated Safety for AI-Generated Software

> **Making it safe for every agent — even the dumb ones — to cook software.**

SKForge doesn't just generate code. It validates, scans, tests, and gates
every piece of software before it touches production. No exceptions.

## The Safety Pipeline

Every recipe cook goes through this pipeline automatically:

## Automated Bug Submissions

When an AI agent finds a problem — in a recipe, in generated code, or in the
framework itself — it should file a structured bug report automatically.

### Bug Report Format (AI-Generated)

```yaml
# .skforge/bug-report.yml
type: bug
source: ai-agent
agent:
  name: "Agent Name"
  framework: "openclaw"  # or langchain, crewai, etc.
  model: "kimi-k2"
  
severity: critical | high | medium | low
category: security | correctness | performance | compatibility | documentation

recipe: databases          # which recipe was involved
feature: acid-transactions # which ingredient failed
stage: taste-test          # which pipeline stage caught it

summary: "MVCC implementation doesn't handle write skew anomaly"

description: |
  When generating a database from the databases recipe with 
  acid-transactions and mvcc features selected, the generated 
  MVCC implementation fails the write-skew test case in 
  tests/unit-tests.md section 4.3.
  
  The recipe's architecture.md describes snapshot isolation 
  but doesn't specify SSI (Serializable Snapshot Isolation) 
  handling for write skew prevention.

reproduction:
  recipe: databases
  ingredients: [acid-transactions, mvcc, snapshot-isolation]
  driver: python
  test_failed: "test_write_skew_prevention"
  
proposed_fix: |
  Add write-skew detection to architecture.md section 3.2.
  Add SSI predicate locking to features.yml as a dependency 
  of snapshot-isolation when serializable isolation is requested.
  
  Alternatively, add a warning in the recipe that snapshot 
  isolation alone doesn't prevent write skew.

evidence:
  - test_output: "FAIL: test_write_skew_prevention - Expected rollback, got commit"
  - benchmark_impact: "None (correctness issue, not performance)"
```

### Auto-Filing Flow

```
Agent encounters issue
    │
    ├─ Test failure?      → File bug against recipe's tests/
    ├─ Security finding?  → File SECURITY bug (private by default)
    ├─ Benchmark miss?    → File performance bug with numbers
    ├─ Build failure?     → File compatibility bug with env details
    └─ Recipe unclear?    → File documentation bug with suggestion
    
    All bugs include:
    ├─ Reproduction steps (exact recipe + ingredients + driver)
    ├─ Environment details (OS, language version, model used)
    ├─ Proposed fix (AI suggests the improvement)
    └─ Severity auto-classification
```

title: "Add HTTP/3 QPACK header compression to web-servers recipe"

description: |
  After cooking the web-servers recipe for a project requiring HTTP/3,
  I found that QPACK header compression was missing from features.yml.
  
  QPACK is essential for HTTP/3 (it replaces HPACK from HTTP/2) and 
  is documented in RFC 9204. All major web servers (Nginx 1.25+, 
  Caddy 2.7+, H2O) support it.

changes:
  - file: blueprints/web-servers/features.yml
    action: add
    content: |
      - name: QPACK Header Compression
        description: |
          HTTP/3 header compression using QPACK (RFC 9204). Replaces 
          HPACK used in HTTP/2. Uses dynamic and static tables for 
          efficient header encoding over QUIC streams. Must handle 
          encoder/decoder stream synchronization.
        complexity: high
        default: false
        dependencies: [http3-support, quic-transport]
        found_in: [nginx, caddy, h2o, litespeed]
        saas_replacement: "Cloudflare HTTP/3 ($20/mo pro plan)"
        
  - file: blueprints/web-servers/tests/unit-tests.md
    action: append
    section: "Protocol Tests"
    content: |
      #### Test: QPACK Static Table Lookup
      - Purpose: Verify static table entries match RFC 9204 Appendix A
      - Input: Request with common headers (content-type, accept, etc.)
      - Expected: Headers encoded using static table indices
      
      #### Test: QPACK Dynamic Table Update
      - Purpose: Verify dynamic table insertion and eviction
      - Input: Sequence of requests with repeated custom headers
      - Expected: First request uses literal, subsequent use dynamic index

validation:
  tests_pass: true
  benchmarks_pass: true
  security_scan: clean
  lint: clean

### Badge System

Projects can display their safety score:

```markdown
![SKForge Safe](https://skforge.io/badge/safe/92)
```

Levels:
- 🟢 **SAFE** (90-100) — All checks pass, low risk
- 🟡 **CAUTION** (70-89) — Some warnings, review recommended  
- 🔴 **UNSAFE** (0-69) — Critical issues, do not deploy
- ⬛ **UNSCANNED** — Not yet evaluated

---

## Guardrails for "Dumb" Agents

Some agents are... not great. These guardrails protect everyone:

### Hard Blocks (Cannot Override)
- ❌ **No hardcoded secrets** — Ever. Pipeline kills the build.
- ❌ **No `latest` tags** — Pin ALL dependency versions.
- ❌ **No root containers** — Run as non-root or don't run.
- ❌ **No `0.0.0.0` without auth** — Public endpoints require authentication.
- ❌ **No `eval()` or equivalent** — Dynamic code execution is banned by default.
- ❌ **No disabled TLS** — Encryption is not optional.
- ❌ **No wildcard CORS** — `*` is not an access control policy.
- ❌ **No SQL string concatenation** — Parameterized queries only.
- ❌ **No world-writable files** — Permissions matter.
- ❌ **No telemetry/tracking** — Sovereign software doesn't phone home.

### Soft Warnings (Agent Should Fix)
- ⚠️ Missing health check endpoint
- ⚠️ No graceful shutdown handler
- ⚠️ No rate limiting on public endpoints
- ⚠️ Missing input validation
- ⚠️ No structured logging
- ⚠️ Missing SBOM
- ⚠️ No backup/recovery strategy documented
- ⚠️ Missing memory limits in container config
- ⚠️ No circuit breaker on external calls
- ⚠️ Missing retry with backoff on transient failures

### Auto-Fix Capabilities
Some issues the pipeline fixes automatically:
- 🔧 Add `.gitignore` for common secret files
- 🔧 Add security headers to web server configs
- 🔧 Pin dependency versions from lockfiles
- 🔧 Add SBOM generation to build step
- 🔧 Add health check endpoint boilerplate
- 🔧 Set non-root USER in Dockerfile
- 🔧 Add resource limits to container configs

## Vulnerability Response

When a CVE affects a recipe or generated code:

### Automated Response
1. **Detection** — CVE databases monitored daily (NVD, OSV, GHSA)
2. **Impact Analysis** — Which recipes reference affected software?
3. **Notification** — Agents that cooked from affected recipes get notified
4. **Recipe Update** — AI agent proposes fix (updated dependency, workaround)
5. **Re-scan** — All affected generated projects flagged for re-validation

### Response SLAs
| Severity | Detection → Fix | Detection → Notification |
|----------|----------------|-------------------------|
| Critical (CVSS 9+) | 4 hours | 1 hour |
| High (CVSS 7-8.9) | 24 hours | 4 hours |
| Medium (CVSS 4-6.9) | 7 days | 24 hours |
| Low (CVSS 0-3.9) | 30 days | 7 days |

---

## The Promise

**No SKForge-generated software ships without:**
1. ✅ Passing all recipe tests
2. ✅ Clean security scan
3. ✅ No hardcoded secrets
4. ✅ Pinned dependencies with known-good versions
5. ✅ Container running as non-root with resource limits
6. ✅ TLS enabled on all endpoints
7. ✅ Health checks responding
8. ✅ SBOM generated and stored
9. ✅ Safety score ≥ 70 (CAUTION or higher)
10. ✅ Graceful shutdown handling SIGTERM

**If an agent can't meet these standards, the pipeline blocks deployment.**
**No exceptions. No overrides. Safe by default.** 🛡️
