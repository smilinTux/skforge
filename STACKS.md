# 🏗️ STACKS.md — Vertical Stack Composition

> **Don't just forge a component. Forge your entire stack.**

## The Problem

Today, building a production software stack means:
1. Choose a database → learn it, configure it, deploy it
2. Choose a cache → learn it, configure it, connect it to the DB
3. Choose a web server → learn it, configure it, point it at your app
4. Choose an API gateway → learn it, configure it, wire up auth
5. Choose a message queue → learn it, configure it, connect producers/consumers
6. Choose a secrets manager → learn it, configure it, inject secrets everywhere
7. Choose monitoring → learn it, configure it for every component above

That's **7 different technologies**, 7 sets of documentation, 7 configuration languages, 7 deployment strategies. Each one takes days to learn. Weeks to master.

**What if you could just describe the stack you want and forge the whole thing?**

## Stack Composer

A **Forgeprint Stack** is a `stack.yml` file that selects one blueprint from each layer and defines how they connect:

## Pre-Built Stack Templates

### 🌐 SaaS Starter
```yaml
# The "I'm building a startup" stack
layers:
  gateway: api-gateways      # Auth + rate limiting
  web: web-servers            # Static + reverse proxy
  database: databases         # PostgreSQL-style
  cache: key-value-stores     # Session store + caching
  queue: message-queues       # Background jobs
deployment: docker-compose
```
**Replaces:** $500-2000/mo in managed services

### 🔍 AI/ML Platform
```yaml
# The "I need embeddings and search" stack
layers:
  gateway: api-gateways       # API auth
  database: databases          # Metadata store
  vectors: vector-databases    # Embedding search (like SKVector!)
  graph: graph-databases       # Knowledge graph (like SKGraph!)
  queue: message-queues        # Embedding pipeline
  storage: object-storage      # Model + dataset storage
deployment: kubernetes
```
**Replaces:** Pinecone ($70/mo) + Neo4j Aura ($65/mo) + S3 ($23/mo) = **$158/mo saved**

### 🏢 Enterprise Backend
```yaml
# The "we need everything" stack
layers:
  gateway: api-gateways
  web: web-servers
  database: databases
  cache: key-value-stores
  search: search-engines
  queue: message-queues
  secrets: secret-management
  orchestrator: container-orchestrators
  workflows: workflow-orchestrators
deployment: kubernetes
```
**Replaces:** Potentially $5,000-50,000/mo in enterprise licenses

### 📝 Notion Killer
```yaml
# The "forge your own workspace" stack
layers:
  gateway: api-gateways        # Auth + API
  web: web-servers              # Frontend serving
  database: databases           # Structured data (pages, blocks, DBs)
  search: search-engines        # Full-text search
  storage: object-storage       # File attachments
  realtime: message-queues      # Live collaboration
deployment: docker-compose
```
**Replaces:** Notion ($8-15/user/mo × entire team)

### 🔒 Zero-Trust Infrastructure (SKStacks Pattern)
```yaml
# The "data sovereignty" stack
layers:
  gateway: api-gateways         # mTLS + RBAC
  secrets: secret-management    # HashiCorp Vault-style
  database: databases           # Encrypted at rest
  vectors: vector-databases     # Sovereign AI memory
  graph: graph-databases        # Relationship mapping
  storage: object-storage       # Encrypted object store
  orchestrator: container-orchestrators  # Self-hosted K8s
deployment: bare-metal
```
**This is literally what SKStacks does.** Now anyone can forge their own.

## How Stack Composition Works

### 1. Layer Independence
Each blueprint is designed to work standalone. No blueprint depends on another specific blueprint — only on standard interfaces (TCP, HTTP, env vars).

### 2. Standard Interfaces
Layers connect through well-defined interfaces:

| Interface | Protocol | Used By |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| `http` | HTTP/HTTPS | Gateway ↔ Web, Web ↔ API |
| `tcp` | Raw TCP | App ↔ Database, App ↔ Cache |
| `amqp` | AMQP/custom | App ↔ Message Queue |
| `grpc` | gRPC | Service ↔ Service |
| `env` | Environment vars | Secrets → All components |
| `dns` | Service discovery | Orchestrator → All |

### 3. Connection Templates
Each blueprint includes connection templates:

```yaml
# In the database blueprint's features.yml:
connections:
  provides:
    - protocol: tcp
      port: 5432
      description: "PostgreSQL wire protocol"
    - protocol: http
      port: 8080
      description: "REST admin API"
  consumes:
    - type: secrets
      description: "Database credentials"
    - type: storage
      description: "Backup destination"
      optional: true
```

### 4. Deployment Targets
The stack composer generates deployment configs for:

| Target | Output | Best For |
|--------|--------|----------|
| `docker-compose` | `docker-compose.yml` | Development, small prod |
| `docker-swarm` | Stack files + configs | Medium production |
| `kubernetes` | Helm chart or K8s manifests | Large production |
| `bare-metal` | systemd units + configs | Maximum control |
| `systemd` | Service files | Single-server deploy |

## The Vision

**Today:** You pick a blueprint, forge ONE component.

**Tomorrow:** You describe a stack, forge EVERYTHING — database, cache, search, API, auth, monitoring, deployment — in one command. Fully integrated. Fully tested. Fully yours.

Every SaaS product is just a stack of open patterns with a UI on top. We document the patterns. AI generates the code. You own the result.

**Don't subscribe to software. Forge your own stack.** 🐧
