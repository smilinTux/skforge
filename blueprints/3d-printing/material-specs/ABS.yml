# ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) Material Specification
# SKForge 3D Printing Blueprint
#
# The classic engineering thermoplastic. High temperature resistance,
# excellent impact strength, and acetone smoothable. Requires enclosed
# printer and ventilation. The material of choice for automotive,
# industrial, and heat-exposed applications.

  acetone_smoothable: true
  acetone_method: |
    Vapor Bath Method:
    1. Place print on raised platform in sealed container
    2. Add acetone-soaked paper towels to container walls (not touching print)
    3. Seal container and wait 15-30 minutes
    4. Remove print and let cure 24 hours in ventilated area
    SAFETY: Work in well-ventilated area. Acetone is flammable. Wear gloves.
  paintable: true
  paint_prep: "Acetone vapor smooth OR sand with 400 grit. ABS accepts paint well."
  glueable_with:
    - acetone (solvent welding) — strongest bond, melts parts together
    - ABS cement (acetone + dissolved ABS)
    - cyanoacrylate — good bond
    - epoxy — structural
  annealable: true
  annealing_temp_c: 100
  annealing_duration_min: 60

storage:
  humidity_sensitive: false  # Low sensitivity compared to PETG/Nylon
  max_humidity_pct: 50
  drying_temp_c: 80
  drying_hours: 4
  shelf_life_months: 24
  storage_note: "ABS is relatively moisture-tolerant but drying improves surface quality."

safety:
  fumes: true
  fume_description: "ABS emits styrene fumes during printing — confirmed respiratory irritant"
  ventilation_required: true
  ventilation_type: "Active extraction to outside or HEPA+carbon filter"
  ppe: "Wear mask if printing in enclosed space without ventilation"

strengths:
  - Excellent heat resistance (98°C HDT) — survives car interiors, near heat sources
  - High impact strength — absorbs shock without shattering
  - Acetone smoothable — professional surface finish achievable
  - Solvent weldable — parts fuse together with acetone for permanent bonds
  - Lightweight (density 1.04) — lighter than PLA and PETG
  - Well-understood material — decades of engineering data available
  - Machineable — can be drilled, tapped, and milled post-print

weaknesses:
  - Requires enclosed printer — warps severely without enclosure
  - Harmful fumes — needs active ventilation during printing
  - Warping prone — large flat parts curl at corners
  - Not food safe — contains acrylonitrile
  - Poor UV resistance — degrades outdoors (use ASA instead)
  - Harder to print than PLA/PETG — more calibration needed

best_for:
  - Automotive parts (dashboard mounts, vent clips)
  - Industrial enclosures near heat sources
  - Parts requiring post-processing to smooth finish
  - Impact-resistant housings (tool cases, protective covers)
  - Functional prototypes matching injection-molded ABS parts
  - Parts that will be painted (excellent paint adhesion)

avoid_for:
  - Outdoor/UV-exposed parts (use ASA instead)
  - Food contact applications
  - Printing without enclosure or ventilation
  - Very large flat parts (extreme warping risk)
  - Beginners (start with PLA/PETG)
