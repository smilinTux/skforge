# PETG (Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol) Material Specification
# SKForge 3D Printing Blueprint
#
# The best all-around functional filament. Combines ease of printing
# with good mechanical properties, chemical resistance, and food-safe
# grades. The go-to choice for enclosures and functional parts.

  enclosure_required: false  # Helps but not required
  bed_adhesion:
    recommended: PEI  # Textured PEI is ideal
    alternatives: [glass_with_glue, BuildTak]
    note: "PETG bonds aggressively to smooth PEI — use textured or apply release agent"
  cooling_fan_pct:
    first_layer: 0
    second_layer: 30
    other_layers: 50  # Moderate cooling — too much causes layer splitting
  max_print_speed_mm_s: 80

  retraction:
    distance_mm: 0.8  # Direct drive — keep low to avoid jams
    bowden_distance_mm: 5.0
    speed_mm_s: 40
    note: "PETG is stringy — tune retraction carefully. Z-hop helps."

    recommended_mm: 0.2
    max_mm: 0.3
  wall_thickness:
    minimum_mm: 0.8

post_processing:
  sandable: true
  sand_grit_progression: [120, 220, 400]
  sand_note: "Harder to sand than PLA. Wet sanding recommended for fine finish."
  acetone_smoothable: false
  paintable: true
  paint_prep: "Scuff sand (220 grit), use adhesion promoter or PETG-compatible primer"
  glueable_with:
    - cyanoacrylate (super glue) — moderate bond
    - epoxy — best structural bond
    - hot glue — acceptable
  annealable: true
  annealing_temp_c: 85
  annealing_duration_min: 30
  annealing_note: "Modest improvement in crystallinity. Less dimensional change than PLA annealing."

storage:
  humidity_sensitive: true  # More sensitive than PLA
  max_humidity_pct: 30
  drying_temp_c: 65
  drying_hours: 4
  shelf_life_months: 6  # Sealed with desiccant
  storage_note: "Absorbs moisture quickly. Wet PETG shows bubbling, stringing, and poor layer adhesion."

strengths:
  - Excellent layer adhesion — very strong inter-layer bonding
  - Good impact resistance — bends before breaking
  - Chemical resistant — survives cleaning agents, light solvents
  - Higher heat resistance than PLA (70°C+ HDT)
  - Food-safe grades available
  - Minimal warping — no enclosure needed
  - Good optical clarity in natural/transparent grades

weaknesses:
  - Stringy — requires careful retraction tuning
  - Aggressive bed adhesion — can damage smooth PEI sheets
  - Moisture sensitive — must be stored dry
  - Harder to post-process (sand, paint) than PLA
  - Slightly flexible — not ideal for rigid precision parts
  - Lower detail resolution than PLA on fine features

best_for:
  - Functional enclosures (electronics, Raspberry Pi cases)
  - Mechanical parts (brackets, mounts, clips)
  - Water-contact items (plant pots, water containers)
  - Food storage containers (certified grades)
  - Parts needing moderate heat resistance
  - Outdoor use with UV-protective coating

avoid_for:
  - High-temperature environments (>70°C sustained)
  - Parts requiring ultra-fine detail (miniatures)
  - Environments with strong UV exposure (long-term outdoor without coating)
  - Applications requiring rigidity (PETG has some flex)
