# PLA (Polylactic Acid) Material Specification
# SKForge 3D Printing Blueprint
#
# The most beginner-friendly FDM filament. Biodegradable, low-odor,
# and requires minimal printer setup. Best for prototypes, decorative
# items, and low-stress functional parts.

post_processing:
  sandable: true
  sand_grit_progression: [120, 220, 400, 800]
  acetone_smoothable: false  # Use other solvents or skip
  paintable: true
  paint_prep: "Light sanding (220 grit), primer recommended"
  glueable_with:
    - cyanoacrylate (super glue) — best bond
    - epoxy — structural
    - hot glue — quick but weak
  annealable: true
  annealing_temp_c: 70
  annealing_duration_min: 60
  annealing_note: "Improves heat resistance to ~80°C but causes ~2-5% dimensional shrinkage"

storage:
  humidity_sensitive: true  # Mild sensitivity
  max_humidity_pct: 40
  drying_temp_c: 45
  drying_hours: 4
  shelf_life_months: 12  # Sealed with desiccant
  storage_note: "Keep sealed with desiccant. Wet PLA produces popping sounds and stringing."

strengths:
  - Easiest material to print — minimal calibration needed
  - Low odor — safe for home/office use without ventilation
  - Wide color selection including silk, matte, and translucent
  - Biodegradable under industrial composting conditions
  - Sharp detail — excellent for miniatures and fine features
  - FDA-approved grades available for food contact

weaknesses:
  - Low heat resistance — deforms above 55-60°C (car dashboards, direct sunlight)
  - Brittle — snaps under impact rather than flexing
  - Poor UV resistance — degrades outdoors over months
  - Not suitable for structural/load-bearing applications
  - Limited chemical resistance

best_for:
  - Prototyping and fit checks
  - Decorative items and display models
  - Miniatures and tabletop gaming pieces
  - Educational projects
  - Low-stress functional parts (cord organizers, desk accessories)
  - Food-contact items (with certified grades)

avoid_for:
  - Outdoor/UV-exposed parts
  - High-temperature environments (near heat sources)
  - Impact-resistant parts (cases that might be dropped)
  - Mechanical load-bearing components
  - Chemical exposure environments
