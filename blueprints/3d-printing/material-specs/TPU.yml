# TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane) Material Specification
# SKForge 3D Printing Blueprint
#
# Flexible/elastic filament for parts that need to bend, compress,
# or absorb impact. Requires direct drive extruder and slow print
# speeds. Shore hardness ranges from 85A (very flexible) to 98A
# (semi-rigid).

properties:
  density_g_cm3: 1.21
  tensile_strength_mpa: 40
  elongation_at_break_pct: 450  # Extremely elastic
  flexural_modulus_mpa: 100
  impact_strength_kj_m2: 50  # Absorbs impact by deforming
  shore_hardness: 95A  # Typical for 3D printing grades
  hardness_range: "85A (very flexible) to 98A (semi-rigid)"

  moisture_absorption: medium
  uv_resistance: fair
  chemical_resistance:
    - water (excellent)
    - oils/greases (excellent)
    - fuels (good)
    - alcohol (good)
    - dilute acids (fair)
    - acetone (poor)
  food_safe: false  # Some specialty grades are, but not standard

print_settings:
  nozzle_temp_c:

    recommended: 230
    max: 250
  bed_temp_c:

  enclosure_required: false

    alternatives: [glass, BuildTak, painters_tape]
    note: "TPU sticks well to most surfaces. May stick TOO well — use release agent."
  cooling_fan_pct:
    first_layer: 0
    second_layer: 30
    other_layers: 50
  max_print_speed_mm_s: 30  # SLOW — critical for TPU
  recommended_speed_mm_s: 25
  speed_note: "TPU buckles in the extruder at high speeds. 20-30mm/s is safe."
  retraction:
    distance_mm: 0.5  # Minimal — TPU compresses in feed path
    bowden_distance_mm: 0  # DO NOT use with bowden — highly recommended direct drive
    speed_mm_s: 25
    note: "Minimize retraction. TPU compresses and jams easily. Direct drive strongly recommended."
  extruder_requirement: "Direct drive REQUIRED. Bowden tube causes buckling and jams."
  layer_height:
    min_mm: 0.15
    recommended_mm: 0.2
    max_mm: 0.3
  wall_thickness:
    minimum_mm: 1.2
    recommended_mm: 1.6
    note: "Thick walls give rigidity. Thin walls maximize flexibility."
  infill_note: "Higher infill = more rigid. Lower infill = more flexible. Gyroid pattern best."

post_processing:
  sandable: false  # Rubber-like surface resists sanding
  acetone_smoothable: false
  paintable: false  # Flexible surface rejects most paints
  paint_note: "Specialty flexible paints (Plasti Dip, flexible automotive paint) may work"
  glueable_with:
    - cyanoacrylate (super glue) — flexible CA works best
    - contact cement — good for rubber-like bonds
    - hot glue — adequate
  annealable: false

storage:
  humidity_sensitive: true
  max_humidity_pct: 30
  drying_temp_c: 50
  drying_hours: 6
  shelf_life_months: 6
  storage_note: "TPU absorbs moisture readily. Wet TPU produces bubbles and poor surface quality."

strengths:
  - Extreme flexibility — bends, compresses, and returns to shape
  - Excellent impact absorption — ideal for protective cases
  - Resistant to abrasion and wear
  - Oil and grease resistant — survives mechanical environments
  - Maintains flexibility at low temperatures (down to -40°C)
  - Good vibration dampening properties
  - Layer adhesion is excellent — strong in all orientations

weaknesses:
  - Requires direct drive extruder — not compatible with bowden setups
  - Must print very slowly (20-30mm/s) — long print times
  - Stringing issues — retraction is limited
  - Cannot be easily post-processed (sanding, painting)
  - Dimensionally less precise — elastic nature causes slight deformation
  - Higher cost than rigid filaments
  - Detail resolution limited at flexible durometers

best_for:
  - Phone cases and protective bumpers
  - Gaskets, seals, and O-ring replacements
  - Vibration dampening mounts (motor mounts, camera gimbals)
  - Flexible hinges (living hinges)
  - Shoe insoles and orthotics
  - Wheels and tires for robots/RC vehicles
  - Wearable accessories (watch bands, bracelets)
  - Grips and handles

avoid_for:
  - Structural/load-bearing parts (too flexible)
  - High-precision dimensional parts
  - Printers with bowden extruders
  - Jobs requiring fast print times
  - Parts that need painting or smooth surface finish
  - Anything requiring rigidity
