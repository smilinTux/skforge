name: BitChat Transport
protocol_version: "BitChat 1.x"

app_store: "iOS App Store + Google Play"
license: "Open source (in progress)"

overview: >
  BitChat is a decentralized peer-to-peer messaging app that operates over
  Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) mesh networks. Created by Jack Dorsey as a
  "weekend project," it enables encrypted communication WITHOUT internet,
  cellular service, phone numbers, email addresses, or central servers.
  Messages hop across devices within ~300m range using store-and-forward.

architecture:
  model: "Bluetooth Low Energy mesh with store-and-forward"
  transport: "Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)"
  range: "~300m per hop (extended through relay devices)"
  identity: "Device-based keypairs"
  encryption: "Native encryption (details being hardened)"
  online_fallback: "Nostr protocol for internet-connected global reach"
  features:
    - ephemeral messages (disappear by default)
    - group chats called "rooms"
    - store-and-forward for offline devices
    - no registration required
    - no phone number, no email

skcomm_integration:
  how_it_works:
    - SKComm envelope PGP-encrypted before entering BitChat
    - Message sent via BLE mesh to nearby devices
    - Devices relay message hop-by-hop until reaching recipient
    - If recipient is out of BLE range, message stored at intermediate nodes
    - When recipient comes within range, message delivered
    - If internet available, falls back to Nostr relay for global reach
    - Double encryption: PGP (mandatory) + BitChat native
  identity_mapping:
    - BitChat device identity separate from CapAuth PGP key
    - CapAuth profile links BitChat device for trust verification
  recommended_as: "OFFLINE transport — the only option when there is NO internet"

properties:
  requires_internet: false
  supports_offline: true
  max_payload_size: "small (BLE packet size constraints, chunking needed)"
  typical_latency_ms: "1000-30000 (depends on hop count and device density)"
  stealth: very_high
  censorship_resistance: very_high
  offline_capable: true
  bidirectional: true

strengths:
  - Works with ZERO internet connectivity
  - Works with ZERO cellular service
  - No central server of any kind
  - Physical proximity required (inherent security property)
  - Low power consumption (BLE)
  - Mesh extends through all nearby devices running BitChat
  - Nostr fallback for global reach when internet available
  - Jack Dorsey backing provides credibility and resources
  - Mobile apps available (iOS + Android)

weaknesses:
  - Limited range (~300m per hop, needs device density for longer distances)
  - Small payload capacity (BLE packet constraints)
  - Security model still being hardened (Block devs acknowledged gaps)
  - Not suitable for high-bandwidth communication
  - Requires nearby devices running BitChat for relay
  - Relatively new — less battle-tested than established protocols

security_notes: >
  Block developers have acknowledged that BitChat doesn't yet meet all stated
  security goals. It lacks standard approaches like Signal-style X3DH + double
  ratchet. For SKComm, this is mitigated by mandatory PGP encryption on top of
  BitChat's native layer — even if BitChat's encryption is broken, PGP holds.

use_cases:
  - Air-gapped environments
  - Festivals and concerts (no cell signal)
  - Natural disaster zones (infrastructure down)
  - Field operations (remote areas)
  - Protest communication (censorship-resistant)
  - Emergency alerts between nearby agents

configuration_example:
  mode: ble_mesh
  nostr_fallback: true
  max_hops: 10
  message_ttl: 3600
  encryption: pgp

    skcomm: "crustacean-penguin-alliance"
