- **Secondary:** "Every SaaS subscription is just a dish you haven't learned to cook yet."
- **Manifesto:** "Open recipes. Forever."

### Mascot
**King Divad** 🐧👨‍🍳 — A penguin wearing a chef's hat. Confident, slightly mischievous, always cooking up something. Appears across all marketing. Think Linux penguin meets Gordon Ramsay energy.

### Brand Voice
SKForge speaks like a head chef who wants everyone to cook. We're the culinary school for software — expert but accessible, opinionated but welcoming. We don't gatekeep recipes. We share them.

**Chef** (chefboyrdave2.1) is the creator — a developer who got tired of ordering takeout software and decided to write the cookbook.

### Color Scheme
- **Primary:** Deep Forge Orange (#FF6B35) — The flame under the pan
- **Secondary:** Steel Blue (#2E86AB) — Clean kitchen, sharp knives
- **Accent:** Bright Spark Yellow (#F9DC5C) — The sizzle
- **Neutral:** Charcoal Gray (#2F2F2F) — Cast iron
- **Light:** Off-white (#FAFAFA) — The plate

### Logo Evolution
The anvil becomes a cast-iron skillet with circuit-board patterns. The spark above becomes steam rising, stylized as code brackets `<>`. King Divad sits beside the wordmark in a chef's hat. Typography stays clean and bold.

## 2. THE LICENSE WARS — WHY SKFORGE EXISTS

### The Pattern

Every year, another "open source" project changes its license. Every year, companies scramble. Every year, millions of dollars and engineering hours burn while lawyers argue about compliance.

**What if you had recipes for everything? What if no vendor could ever hold your software hostage again?**

That's SKForge. Open recipes. Forever.

### The Drama Timeline

#### 🔥 MongoDB SSPL (2018) — The One That Started It All
MongoDB switched from open source to SSPL. Cloud providers couldn't offer MongoDB-as-a-service without SSPL compliance. Spawned FerretDB, SurrealDB, and a whole generation of "wait, can they DO that?"

**SKForge:** *"The document database that started the license wars. Now you can cook your own."*

#### 🔥 CentOS Death → Rocky/Alma (2020-2023)
Red Hat killed CentOS (the stable RHEL clone everyone depended on), replaced it with the unstable CentOS Stream. Then in 2023, they restricted RHEL source access entirely. Rocky Linux and AlmaLinux emerged as community forks.

**SKForge:** *"Even your OS can get rug-pulled. That's why we recipe everything."*

#### 🔥 Elasticsearch → OpenSearch (January 2021)
Elastic changed Elasticsearch from Apache 2.0 to SSPL. AWS forked it as OpenSearch. Massive community split. Years of confusion about compatibility.

**SKForge:** *"Search shouldn't be a hostage situation."*

#### 🔥 Docker Desktop Licensing (2021)
Docker Inc started requiring paid subscriptions for Docker Desktop at large companies. Pushed the industry toward Podman, Rancher Desktop, colima.

**SKForge:** *"Your containers, your kitchen, your rules."*

#### 🔥 Grafana's AGPL Move (2021)
Grafana moved from Apache 2.0 to AGPLv3. Amazon forked the older Apache version. Even "open" tools can change the rules.

**SKForge:** *"Dashboards are too important to be someone else's business model."*

#### 🔥 HashiCorp / OpenTofu (August 2023)
HashiCorp changed Terraform — THE standard for infrastructure as code — from MPL-2.0 to BSL. The community was furious. Linux Foundation forked it as OpenTofu within weeks. Companies that built their entire infrastructure on Terraform suddenly had license risk overnight.

**SKForge:** *"If you had a recipe, you could've cooked your own Terraform. No vendor can rug-pull a recipe."*

#### 🔥 Redis License Change (March 2024)
Redis Labs changed Redis from BSD to dual RSALv2/SSPLv2. Linux Foundation forked it as Valkey. AWS, Google, and Oracle all backed the fork. Companies scrambled.

**SKForge:** *"Your cache shouldn't come with a lawyer. Forge your own."*

## 3. WEBSITE COPY (skforge.io)

### Hero Section
**Headline:** Don't order software. Cook your own. 🐧🍳
**Subheadline:** AI-native recipes that generate complete, production-ready software in any language. Pick your ingredients, choose your dish, let AI do the cooking. Free. Forever. No vendor can rug-pull a recipe.
**CTA:** Open the Cookbook →

### "How It Works" Section — The Kitchen Method
1. **🧑‍🍳 Pick a Recipe** — Browse our Cookbook: databases, web servers, load balancers, and dozens more dishes
2. **🥘 Choose Your Ingredients** — Select features from expert-curated checklists. Only what you need, nothing you don't.
3. **🔪 Select Your Style** — Rust, Go, Python, JavaScript, or any language your AI chef understands
4. **🍳 Cook** — Feed the recipe to any LLM and get complete, tested, production-ready code
5. **🍽️ Serve** — Deploy YOUR software. No license strings. No subscription. Yours forever.

### "Why Cook Your Own?" Section

**The License Rug Pull is Real.**

In the last 6 years, MongoDB, Elasticsearch, Redis, Terraform, Docker, CentOS, and Grafana all changed their licenses. Companies that depended on them scrambled. Forks appeared. Lawyers got rich. Engineers lost sleep.

**What if you had the recipe?** What if, when HashiCorp changed Terraform's license, you could just... cook your own? From a recipe you already had?

That's SKForge. A cookbook of AI-native recipes for every piece of software you depend on.

- **🔓 No License Risk:** Recipes are MIT. Generated code is yours. Period.
- **🎯 Exactly What You Need:** No bloat, no compromises, no "close enough"
- **🌐 Any Language:** Your recipe works in Rust, Go, Python, or whatever tomorrow brings
- **🤖 AI-Native:** Designed for LLMs to cook from — not templates, not boilerplate
- **🐧 Community Driven:** Chef + community. Share your recipes. Improve the cookbook.
- **💰 Free Forever:** No tiers, no "freemium," no enterprise traps

### FAQ Section

**Q: Is this a framework?**
A: No. Frameworks tell you HOW to cook. Recipes tell you WHAT to cook. Big difference. You end up with YOUR code, not framework-dependent code.

**Q: What LLMs can cook from these recipes?**
A: Any modern LLM — GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, local models. The recipes are designed to be universally understood.

**Q: Can a vendor change YOUR recipes?**
A: No. That's the entire point. MIT licensed. Once you have the recipe, it's yours forever. No rug pulls.

**Q: How is this different from just asking AI to build something?**
A: Garbage in, garbage out. Our recipes are expert-curated specifications covering architecture, security, testing, and deployment. The difference between "make me a web server" and a Michelin-star recipe for one.

**Q: Who is Chef?**
A: chefboyrdave2.1 — a developer who got tired of ordering takeout software and decided to write the cookbook for everyone. 🐧👨‍🍳

**Q: Can I share my own recipes?**
A: That's what the Cookbook is for! Community-contributed recipes make everyone's kitchen better.

**Post 1 — The License Drama Trend**

**The Open Source Rug Pull: A Timeline**

In 2018, MongoDB changed its license to SSPL. Cloud providers couldn't offer it as a service anymore.

In 2020, Red Hat killed CentOS — the stable RHEL clone that thousands of companies depended on.

In 2021, Elasticsearch went SSPL. Docker started charging. Grafana went AGPL.

In 2023, HashiCorp changed Terraform — the STANDARD for infrastructure as code — to BSL. The Linux Foundation forked it as OpenTofu within weeks. Then Red Hat restricted RHEL source access.

In 2024, Redis changed from BSD to dual RSALv2/SSPLv2. AWS, Google, and Oracle backed a fork called Valkey.

See the pattern?

Every year, another "open source" tool changes the rules. Every year, companies scramble — evaluating forks, consulting lawyers, migrating workloads, burning engineering cycles.

**The question isn't IF your next dependency will change its license. It's WHEN.**

At smilinTux, we asked a different question: What if companies had the recipe to cook their own?

That's SKForge — an open-source cookbook of AI-native software recipes. Comprehensive specifications that any LLM can use to generate production-ready software in any language.

No vendor can rug-pull a recipe. No license can change on code YOU generated from YOUR recipe.

The cookbook is open. The recipes are free. Forever.

**Post 2 — The Kitchen/Recipe Vision**

**Why We're Calling Software Specs "Recipes" (And It's Not Just Branding)**

When you order takeout every night, you're dependent on the restaurant. Their prices. Their hours. Their menu changes.

When you learn to cook, you're free.

This is exactly what's happening in software. Companies "order" their infrastructure from vendors — databases, caches, search engines, monitoring tools. It works great until the vendor changes the menu (or the price, or the license).

SKForge is a cookbook. Each recipe contains:
- 🥘 **Ingredients** — every feature, precisely specified
- 📋 **Method** — architecture, patterns, security considerations
- 🧪 **Quality checks** — comprehensive test specifications
- 🍽️ **Plating** — deployment and documentation

Hand any recipe to an AI (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, local models) and it cooks you production-ready software in your preferred language.

The analogy isn't just cute. It's structural:
- You can modify any recipe to your taste
- You can combine recipes into full menus (complete stacks)
- You can share recipes with your team
- Nobody can take away a recipe you already have

Our creator, Chef (chefboyrdave2.1), says it best: "Every SaaS subscription is just a dish you haven't learned to cook yet."

We're building the cookbook. 50+ dishes and growing. Community contributions welcome.

**Post 3 — Stack Composition (The Full Course Meal)**

**Forget Individual Tools. Forge Your Entire Kitchen.**

Most companies assemble their tech stack like a buffet — a little Postgres here, some Redis there, Elasticsearch for search, Grafana for monitoring, Terraform for infra...

Each one from a different vendor. Each one with its own license. Each one a potential rug-pull.

SKForge introduces **Menus** — curated collections of recipes that work together as a complete stack. Think of it as a Prix Fixe dinner for your infrastructure:

**The Self-Hosted Starter Menu:**
- 🥗 Appetizer: Reverse proxy with auto-SSL
- 🍝 First Course: API gateway with auth
- 🥩 Main Course: Application server
- 🧀 Side: Cache layer
- 🍰 Dessert: Monitoring dashboard

**The Data Platform Full Course:**
- Document store
- Search engine
- Cache layer
- Message queue
- Analytics dashboard

Every recipe in a Menu is designed to work with the others. Shared auth patterns. Compatible APIs. Unified deployment configs.

One Menu. One AI session. One afternoon. Your entire stack — generated, tested, documented, and completely yours.

No vendor lock-in. No license anxiety. No "what if they change the terms?"

The kitchen is open. Come cook.

### Reddit Posts

**r/selfhosted**

**Title:** The open source license rug-pull keeps happening. What if you could just... cook your own software?

MongoDB. Elasticsearch. Redis. Terraform. Docker. CentOS. Grafana.

All changed their licenses. All sent companies scrambling.

If you self-host, you've felt this pain. You build your entire stack around a tool, and then the vendor changes the deal.

I got tired of it. So I started writing recipes.

**SKForge** is an open-source cookbook of AI-native software recipes. Each recipe is a comprehensive specification that any LLM (GPT-4, Claude, local models) can use to generate production-ready software in any language.

For the self-hosted crowd, this means:
- 🏠 Cook your own reverse proxy (no more Traefik license anxiety)
- 🗄️ Cook your own database (no more MongoDB SSPL headaches)
- 📊 Cook your own monitoring (Grafana went AGPL, remember?)
- 🔍 Cook your own search (Elasticsearch → SSPL)
- 💾 Cook your own cache (Redis → RSALv2)

Every recipe includes Docker configs, compose files, and deployment guides. Generated code is YOURS — MIT license on the recipes, and the output is your code.

50+ recipes and growing. Community contributions welcome.

No vendor can rug-pull a recipe. 🐧👨‍🍳

**r/opensource**

**Title:** I'm building a cookbook of AI-native software recipes after watching 7 major open source projects change their licenses

The timeline is getting ridiculous:
- 2018: MongoDB → SSPL
- 2020: CentOS killed
- 2021: Elasticsearch → SSPL, Docker licensing, Grafana → AGPL
- 2023: Terraform → BSL, RHEL source restricted
- 2024: Redis → RSALv2/SSPLv2

Every time, the community scrambles. Forks appear. Lawyers get involved. Engineers migrate.

I started asking: what if we had comprehensive, open recipes for all of this software? Recipes that any AI could cook from?

**SKForge** is exactly that — an MIT-licensed cookbook of AI-native software specifications. Not templates. Not boilerplate. Detailed recipes covering architecture, testing, security, and deployment that any LLM can use to generate production-ready code in any language.

The core idea: **No vendor can rug-pull a recipe.**

If you had a recipe for Terraform, the HashiCorp BSL change would've been a non-event. If you had a recipe for Redis, you wouldn't need to evaluate Valkey. If you had a recipe for Elasticsearch, OpenSearch vs Elasticsearch would be irrelevant.

50+ dishes in the cookbook. Community-driven. Free forever.

The recipes are MIT. The generated code is yours. No strings.

→ skforge.io

I'd love feedback from this community. What's missing? What should we recipe next?

**r/devops**

**Title:** After HashiCorp rug-pulled Terraform's license, I started building recipes for every piece of infra

You all remember August 2023. HashiCorp changes Terraform from MPL-2.0 to BSL. Overnight, the tool that EVERYONE uses for IaC has license risk.

Then March 2024: Redis goes RSALv2/SSPLv2.

Before that: Elasticsearch, Docker Desktop, Grafana, CentOS...

I work in infra. This pattern terrifies me. Our entire stack is someone else's business model.

So I started writing **recipes** — detailed, AI-native specifications for every piece of infrastructure software. Hand a recipe to any LLM, pick your language, and it generates production-ready code.

**SKForge** has 50+ recipes including:
- ⚖️ Load balancers
- 🔄 Reverse proxies
- 📊 Monitoring/observability stacks
- 🗄️ Databases (document, relational, KV)
- 💾 Cache layers
- 📨 Message queues
- 🌐 API gateways
- 🔐 Auth systems

Plus **Menus** — curated recipe collections for complete stacks. One Menu = one AI session = your entire infra, generated and tested.

MIT licensed. Generated code is yours. No vendor can rug-pull a recipe.

What infra would you cook first?

**r/homelab**

**Title:** Tired of license changes killing your homelab stack? Here's a cookbook to cook your own software 🐧🍳

Homelabbers, you know the pain:
- Set up Elasticsearch → license changes → evaluate OpenSearch
- Set up Redis → license changes → evaluate Valkey
- Docker Desktop → starts charging → switch to Podman
- CentOS → killed → migrate to Rocky

What if your homelab ran on software YOU cooked from open recipes?

**SKForge** is an open-source cookbook of AI-native software recipes. Pick a recipe, hand it to any AI (even local models on your homelab!), and it generates production-ready software in whatever language you want.

For homelabbers:
- 🏠 Cook your own NAS management interface
- 📊 Cook your own monitoring dashboard (bye Grafana AGPL)
- 🌐 Cook your own reverse proxy with auto-SSL
- 🗄️ Cook your own lightweight database
- 🔐 Cook your own auth system
- 📺 Cook your own media server dashboard

Every recipe includes Docker/compose configs. Run it on your homelab hardware. It's YOUR code.

50+ recipes. MIT licensed. Free forever. Community-driven.

No vendor can rug-pull a recipe. 🐧👨‍🍳

### Hacker News Strategy

**Title:** Show HN: We're writing recipes for every SaaS so AI can cook alternatives

**Top Comment (by Chef):**

Hi HN! I'm Chef (chefboyrdave2.1), creator of SKForge.

After watching MongoDB (2018), CentOS (2020), Elasticsearch (2021), Docker (2021), Grafana (2021), Terraform (2023), RHEL (2023), and Redis (2024) all change their licenses, I noticed a pattern: companies that depend on open source have no insurance against license changes.

SKForge is that insurance. It's a cookbook of AI-native software recipes — comprehensive specifications that any LLM can use to generate production-ready software in any language.

Key design decisions:
- **Recipes, not templates.** These are detailed specs covering architecture, security, testing, and deployment. The difference between "make me pasta" and an actual recipe.
- **Language agnostic.** The same recipe generates Rust, Go, Python, or whatever. The spec is the knowledge; the language is the style.
- **Composable.** Recipes combine into Menus (full stacks). A "Self-Hosted Platform" Menu gives you a complete infra in one AI session.
- **MIT licensed.** The recipes are MIT. The generated code is yours. No SSPL, no BSL, no AGPL surprises.

We have 50+ recipes across databases, web servers, load balancers, monitoring, auth, APIs, CLI tools, and more. Growing weekly with community contributions.

The thesis: "Every SaaS subscription is just a dish you haven't learned to cook yet."

Technical details, architecture, and the full cookbook at skforge.io. Happy to answer questions about the recipe format, AI compatibility, or any of the implementation details.

**Follow-up comments to prepare:**

*On "how is this different from just prompting an AI?"*
> Same way a cookbook is different from "make me food." Our recipes are expert-curated specifications covering edge cases, security patterns, testing strategies, and architecture decisions that took hundreds of hours to develop. The difference in output quality is dramatic.

*On "this won't replace production software"*
> It already has for us. We're running several SKForge-generated services in production. The recipes include comprehensive testing specs, security considerations, and deployment patterns. The AI output isn't a toy — it's production code built from production specs.

*On the license drama angle*
> The license change timeline is wild when you lay it out: MongoDB (2018) → CentOS (2020) → Elasticsearch, Docker, Grafana (2021) → Terraform, RHEL (2023) → Redis (2024). That's not a blip. That's a trend. We think the answer isn't better forks — it's recipes that make you independent of any single implementation.

## 6. EMAIL SEQUENCES

### Welcome Series (3 emails)

**Email 1 — "Welcome to the Kitchen"**

**Subject:** Your first recipe is ready to cook 🐧🍳

Hey [Name],

Welcome to SKForge's kitchen.

You just joined a community of developers who are done ordering takeout software and ready to cook their own.

Here's what you need to know:

🐧 **King Divad** is our mascot. He's a penguin in a chef's hat. He's judging your code. Lovingly.

📖 **The Cookbook** has 50+ recipes — databases, web servers, load balancers, monitoring, auth, APIs, and more.

🍳 **Cooking is simple:** Pick a recipe → Choose your language → Feed it to any LLM → Get production-ready code

Your first assignment: Pick ONE recipe that replaces something you currently pay for. Cook it. See what happens.

→ Browse the Cookbook: skforge.io/cookbook

Welcome to the kitchen, chef.

— Chef (chefboyrdave2.1) 🐧👨‍🍳

P.S. Every SaaS subscription is just a dish you haven't learned to cook yet.

**Email 2 — "Why We Cook" (Day 3)**

**Subject:** HashiCorp changed Terraform's license. Here's what we did about it.

Hey [Name],

Quick history lesson:

- 2018: MongoDB changes license → SSPL
- 2020: Red Hat kills CentOS
- 2021: Elasticsearch → SSPL, Docker starts charging, Grafana → AGPL
- 2023: HashiCorp changes Terraform → BSL, Red Hat restricts RHEL source
- 2024: Redis → RSALv2/SSPLv2

See the pattern?

Every year, another "open source" project changes the deal. Every year, companies burn millions migrating, evaluating forks, and consulting lawyers.

**We decided to write the recipes instead.**

If you have the recipe for Terraform, a license change is a non-event. You just cook your own. From your recipe. In your kitchen. On your terms.

That's why SKForge exists. Not because we hate these projects — many are excellent. But because **no one should be held hostage by a vendor's licensing decisions.**

The recipes are MIT. The code you generate is yours. Forever.

**Email 3 — "Your Full Course Meal" (Day 7)**

**Subject:** Stop ordering à la carte. Here's the full menu. 🍽️

Hey [Name],

Individual recipes are great. But the real power is the **Menu**.

A Menu is a curated set of recipes that work together as a complete stack. One AI session. One afternoon. Your entire infrastructure.

**The Self-Hosted Starter Menu:**
- 🥗 Reverse proxy with auto-SSL
- 🍝 API gateway with auth
- 🥩 Application server
- 🧀 Cache layer
- 🍰 Monitoring dashboard

**The Data Platform Prix Fixe:**
- Document store
- Search engine
- Cache layer
- Message queue
- Analytics dashboard

Every recipe in a Menu shares auth patterns, compatible APIs, and unified deployment configs. They're designed to be cooked together.

No vendor lock-in. No license anxiety. No "what if they change the terms on three of our five core dependencies?"

Bon appétit.

### Script 2: "Why I'm Blueprinting the Entire Software Industry" — Chef's Story (90 seconds)

[Chef talking to camera, kitchen background]
**Chef:** "I'm Chef. I build software. And I'm tired of getting rug-pulled."

"In August 2023, HashiCorp changed Terraform's license. Terraform. The tool EVERYONE uses. Overnight, every company using it had license risk."

"And it wasn't the first time. MongoDB did it. Elasticsearch. Redis. Docker. Even CentOS."

[Cut to whiteboard with timeline]
"So I asked myself: what if I wrote down the recipe? Not the code — the recipe. The specification. Everything you need to cook your own."

[Cut back to Chef]
"That's SKForge. A cookbook. Fifty-plus recipes for databases, web servers, load balancers, monitoring — every piece of software you depend on."

"Hand any recipe to an AI. It cooks you production-ready code. In any language. And here's the important part..."

[Leans in]
"No one can change the license on a recipe you already have."

[King Divad appears on shoulder]
"Don't order software. Cook your own."

## 10. ONE-PAGER (PDF-Ready)

# SKFORGE 🐧👨‍🍳
## The Software Cookbook
*Don't order software. Cook your own.*

### THE PROBLEM
Every year, another "open source" project changes its license. MongoDB. Elasticsearch. Redis. Terraform. Docker. CentOS. Grafana. Companies scramble, engineers migrate, lawyers profit. Your software stack is someone else's business model.

### THE SOLUTION
SKForge is an open-source cookbook of AI-native software recipes. Each recipe is a comprehensive specification that any LLM can use to generate production-ready software in any language. No vendor can rug-pull a recipe.

### HOW IT WORKS
1. **🧑‍🍳 Pick a Recipe** — 50+ dishes: databases, web servers, caches, monitoring, auth, and more
2. **🥘 Choose Ingredients** — Select features from expert-curated checklists
3. **🔪 Pick Your Style** — Rust, Go, Python, JS, or any language
4. **🍳 Cook** — Feed the recipe to any LLM → production-ready code
5. **🍽️ Serve** — Deploy YOUR code. No license strings. Yours forever.

### THE MENU (Stack Composition)
Combine recipes into Menus — complete infrastructure stacks generated in one session. Self-hosted platform. Data pipeline. DevOps toolkit. One Menu, one afternoon, zero vendor lock-in.

### WHY NOW?
Every SaaS subscription is just a dish you haven't learned to cook yet. AI can now cook from recipes. The cookbook is open. The kitchen is yours.

*This marketing package positions SKForge as the antidote to the open source license rug-pull epidemic, wrapped in a kitchen metaphor that makes complex software independence feel accessible, fun, and inevitable. King Divad approves. 🐧👨‍🍳🔥*
