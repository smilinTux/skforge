## 1.4 Architecture Patterns

### HNSW Graph Construction
- Layered skip-list–inspired graph: top layers sparse (long-range links), bottom layers dense (local)
- Insert: find entry point at top layer, greedily descend, connect at each level with max M neighbors
- Build complexity: O(N·log(N)); query: O(log(N))
- Parameters: M (edges/node, typ. 16), ef_construction (search width, typ. 128-512)

### Segment Management
- Data organized into immutable segments (like LSM SSTables) + mutable memtable
- New writes go to WAL → memtable → flush to segment when threshold reached
- Background optimizer merges small segments, re-indexes with updated HNSW
- Deleted points marked as tombstones, cleaned on merge

### WAL + Memtable
- WAL: append-only sequential writes for crash recovery
- Memtable: in-memory buffer for recent writes; supports search immediately
- Flush: memtable → immutable segment on disk with full HNSW index
- Recovery: replay WAL entries not yet flushed

### Quantization Strategies
- **Scalar (SQ8)**: per-dimension min/max → int8; 4x compression; ~1-3% recall loss
- **Product (PQ)**: split vector into subspaces, cluster each, store centroid IDs; 10-50x compression; 5-10% recall loss
- **Binary**: sign bit per dimension; 32x compression; best for oversampling + rescore
- **Matryoshka**: progressive dimension truncation; works with MRL-trained embeddings

### Distributed Consensus
- Raft protocol for cluster metadata (collection configs, shard assignments)
- Data replication: synchronous or eventual per write concern
- Shard-level leader/follower; queries fan out to shard leaders

## 1.5 Memory Management
- HNSW index: ~(4·dim + 8·M) bytes per vector (float32, M=16 → ~512B overhead for 128-dim)
- Raw vectors: 4·dim bytes each (float32); 2·dim for float16
- Quantized: SQ8 = dim bytes; PQ = n_subquantizers bytes; Binary = dim/8 bytes
- Payload indexes: B-tree or hash; typically 50-200 bytes per indexed field per point
- Memory-mapped segments: OS page cache manages hot/cold data automatically
- Recommended: keep HNSW graph in RAM, vectors on mmap, payload indexes in RAM

## 1.6 Testing Criteria
- **Recall@K**: measure search accuracy at K=1,10,100 vs brute force
- **QPS (queries/sec)**: throughput at target recall (e.g., 0.95 recall)
- **Latency P50/P95/P99**: at various concurrency levels
- **Index build time**: time to index N vectors (1M, 10M, 100M benchmarks)
- **Memory efficiency**: RAM per million vectors at target recall
- **Filter performance**: speed degradation with selective metadata filters
- **Write throughput**: sustained upsert rate
- **Recovery time**: WAL replay + index warm-up duration
- **Cluster rebalance**: time to redistribute after node add/remove
- **ANN-benchmarks suite**: standardized comparison (ann-benchmarks.com datasets)

## 2.4 Architecture Patterns

### Adjacency List vs Matrix Storage
- **Adjacency List (dominant)**: Each node stores pointer-list to connected edges; O(degree) traversal per hop; memory-efficient for sparse graphs
- **Adjacency Matrix**: N×N matrix; O(1) lookup but O(N²) space; only viable for small dense graphs or GPU-accelerated analytics
- **Index-Free Adjacency** (Neo4j): Nodes contain direct physical pointers to relationships → O(1) per hop regardless of total graph size; eliminates index lookups during traversal

### Graph Partitioning
- **Hash partitioning**: distribute nodes by hash(id) → even distribution but cuts many edges
- **Label-based**: co-locate nodes with same label → good for label-specific queries
- **Community-based**: detect communities, keep them on same shard → minimal cross-shard traversals
- **Edge-cut vs Vertex-cut**: edge-cut splits nodes across partitions; vertex-cut replicates nodes at boundaries

### Query Execution
- Parse Cypher → AST → Logical Plan → Physical Plan → Execution
- Pattern matching via expand operators: start from anchored nodes (indexed), expand along relationships
- Cost-based optimizer chooses index scans, join strategies, expand directions
- Lazy/streaming execution: results emitted per row, not materialized fully
- Morsel-driven parallelism (Memgraph): work-stealing on chunks of data

### Transaction Management
- WAL for durability; page-level or record-level locking
- Neo4j: record-level locks, optimistic reads, deadlock detection with tx restart
- FalkorDB: single-writer (Redis threading model), readers don't block
- Multi-version concurrency (some): readers see consistent snapshot

## 2.5 Memory Management
- **Node storage**: fixed-size records (Neo4j: 15 bytes/node on disk) + property chains
- **Relationship storage**: fixed-size records (Neo4j: 34 bytes/rel) with doubly-linked per node
- **Property storage**: dynamic records; short strings inline, long strings in separate store
- **Page cache**: memory-mapped or custom page cache for store files; should fit working set
- **Index memory**: B-tree nodes in page cache; GDS projections in heap (can be large)
- **FalkorDB specifics**: entire graph in Redis memory; sparse matrix (GraphBLAS) ~40-80 bytes per edge
- **Estimation**: 1M nodes + 5M edges ≈ 0.5-2 GB RAM depending on property density

## 2.6 Testing Criteria
- **Traversal throughput**: hops/second for k-hop neighborhood queries
- **Path finding latency**: shortest path between random pairs at various graph sizes
- **Algorithm runtime**: PageRank/Community detection on standard benchmarks (LDBC SNB)
- **Write throughput**: nodes+edges/second for bulk and transactional writes
- **Concurrent query performance**: throughput under mixed read/write workload
- **LDBC Social Network Benchmark**: standardized graph DB benchmark
- **Deep traversal cost**: performance degradation at 4, 6, 8+ hops
- **Memory per million edges**: baseline memory consumption
- **Recovery time**: startup + cache warm-up after crash
- **Query plan stability**: consistent performance for repeated query patterns

## 3.4 Architecture Patterns

### Single-threaded Event Loop (Redis)
- One main thread handles all commands sequentially → no locks, no race conditions
- I/O multiplexing via epoll/kqueue; I/O threads (6.0+) handle read/write, main thread executes
- Guarantees atomicity of individual commands without explicit locking
- Throughput: ~100k-300k ops/sec single-thread; I/O threads help with large payloads

### Multi-threaded (DragonflyDB, KeyDB)
- DragonflyDB: shared-nothing architecture per core; each thread owns a shard of keyspace
- KeyDB: multiple worker threads with per-key locking; same data visible to all threads
- Both: 10-25x throughput over Redis for multi-core machines

### Memory Allocator
- jemalloc (default): arena-based, reduces fragmentation; thread-local caches
- Allocator stats via `MEMORY STATS`; fragmentation ratio = RSS / used_memory
- DragonflyDB uses mimalloc; competitive fragmentation characteristics

### Fork-based Persistence
- RDB: fork() → child process writes consistent snapshot while parent continues serving
- Copy-on-write: child shares memory pages; only modified pages get duplicated
- Risk: 2x memory usage peak during save if heavy writes during snapshot
- AOF rewrite: similar fork; child writes compacted AOF, parent appends new ops to buffer

### Gossip Protocol (Cluster)
- Each node pings random nodes every 100ms with cluster state (slots, epochs, health)
- Failure detection: node marked PFAIL (suspected) → FAIL (confirmed by majority)
- Config epochs: monotonically increasing; resolves split-brain slot ownership
- Slot migration: IMPORTING/MIGRATING states; ASK/MOVED redirects during transition

## 3.5 Memory Management
- **String encoding**: int (8 bytes) for integers; embstr (<44 bytes inline); raw (SDS dynamic string)
- **List encoding**: listpack (small) → quicklist (linked list of zipped chunks)
- **Set encoding**: listpack (small int sets) → hashtable
- **Sorted set encoding**: listpack (small) → skiplist + hashtable
- **Hash encoding**: listpack (small) → hashtable
- **Overhead**: ~70 bytes per key (dict entry + SDS key + expiry + type) + value encoding
- **maxmemory**: set hard limit; choose eviction policy; monitor via `INFO memory`
- **1M string keys (100B values)**: ~200-250 MB total (keys + values + overhead)

## 3.6 Testing Criteria
- **Throughput**: ops/sec via redis-benchmark or memtier_benchmark
- **Latency**: P50/P99/P999 at various concurrency (1, 10, 100, 1000 clients)
- **Memory efficiency**: bytes per key-value pair vs theoretical minimum
- **Persistence impact**: throughput drop during RDB save / AOF rewrite
- **Failover time**: Sentinel/Cluster failover latency (detection + promotion)
- **Cluster rebalance**: time to migrate N slots between nodes
- **Large key handling**: performance with 1MB, 10MB, 100MB values
- **Pub/Sub fan-out**: latency with 1k, 10k, 100k subscribers
- **Lua script overhead**: per-script invocation cost
- **Data structure operations**: O(1) vs O(N) behavior validation at scale

## 4.4 Architecture Patterns

### Storage Engine (WiredTiger)
- Default since MongoDB 3.2; B-tree for indexes, page-based storage for documents
- MVCC: readers see consistent snapshot; no read locks
- Compression: snappy (default), zlib, zstd for documents; prefix compression for indexes
- Internal page cache (separate from OS file cache): default 50% of (RAM - 1GB)
- Checkpoint: every 60s; write dirty pages to disk; journal for crash recovery between checkpoints

### Oplog Replication
- Oplog: capped collection on primary recording every write as an idempotent operation
- Secondaries tail the oplog and apply operations in order
- Initial sync: full copy from a sync source, then switch to oplog tailing
- Replication lag: seconds typically; monitor with `rs.printReplicationInfo()`

### Chunk-based Sharding
- Collection divided into chunks (default 128MB) based on shard key range
- Balancer: background process migrates chunks from overloaded to underloaded shards
- Targeted queries: if query includes shard key, route to single shard
- Scatter-gather: if query doesn't include shard key, broadcast to all shards

### Mongos Routing
- Stateless query router; caches config metadata
- Client connects to mongos, not directly to shards
- Multiple mongos instances for HA (behind load balancer)

## 4.5 Memory Management
- **WiredTiger cache**: default max(50% of (RAM - 1GB), 256MB); stores decompressed pages
- **Index memory**: B-tree internal nodes ideally fit in cache; compound indexes larger
- **Document size limit**: 16MB per document
- **Connection overhead**: ~1MB per connection (thread stack); use connection pooling
- **Working set**: ideally fits in WiredTiger cache; disk-bound if exceeded
- **Estimation**: 1M documents (1KB avg) ≈ 1GB data + 500MB-2GB indexes depending on index count
- **Sharding**: distributes memory requirements across nodes

## 4.6 Testing Criteria
- **YCSB benchmark**: standardized workloads A-F (read-heavy to scan-heavy)
- **Write throughput**: inserts/sec for single doc, bulk, and with indexes
- **Read latency**: P50/P99 for point lookups, range queries, aggregations
- **Aggregation pipeline**: complex multi-stage pipeline execution time
- **Index build time**: foreground vs background index creation
- **Replication lag**: under sustained write load
- **Failover time**: primary failure detection → election → new primary serving
- **Sharded query routing**: targeted vs scatter-gather latency difference
- **Transaction overhead**: multi-doc transaction latency vs single-doc
- **Change stream throughput**: events/sec delivery to consumers

## 5.4 Architecture Patterns

### Time-Structured Merge Tree (TSM — InfluxDB)
- Similar to LSM but optimized for time-ordered data
- WAL → in-memory cache → flush to TSM files (sorted by time + series key)
- TSM files: header + index block (min/max time per series) + data blocks (compressed)
- Compaction: level-based; merge overlapping TSM files; reduce file count
- Shard groups: each covers a time range; old shards become read-only

### Inverted Index for Tags (Prometheus/VM)
- Map label → list of series IDs containing that label
- Posting lists: sorted arrays of series IDs; intersect for multi-label queries
- Memory-mapped for fast access; built during block compaction
- High cardinality risk: millions of unique label values = huge index

### Chunk-based Storage (Prometheus)
- Head block: current ~2h in-memory (gorilla-compressed)
- Every 2h: cut block → write to disk as immutable block with index
- Compaction: merge small blocks into larger ones (up to retention limit)
- Each block: chunks/ (compressed samples), index (label→series), meta.json, tombstones

### Write-Ahead Log
- Every incoming sample written to WAL segment before in-memory
- WAL segments: fixed size (~128MB); sequential writes for throughput
- On recovery: replay WAL segments to rebuild head block
- Checkpoint: periodically truncate WAL by writing head state to disk

## 5.5 Memory Management
- **Prometheus head block**: ~3 bytes per sample (gorilla); 120 samples per series per 2h block
- **Series memory**: ~2-5KB per active series (labels + chunk references + indexes)
- **Rule**: RAM ≈ (active_series × 5KB) + (ingestion_rate × 2h × 3B) + index overhead
- **VictoriaMetrics**: ~1KB per active series; merge-tree with aggressive compression
- **InfluxDB IOx**: leverages Apache Arrow memory model; columnar batches
- **Cardinality is key**: 1M active series ≈ 5-10 GB RAM in Prometheus; reduce labels to control

## 5.6 Testing Criteria
- **Write throughput**: data points/sec (target: millions/sec for modern TSDBs)
- **Query latency**: range query over 1h/1d/7d/30d windows at various resolutions
- **Compression ratio**: bytes per data point on disk
- **Compaction overhead**: CPU/IO impact during background compaction
- **Cardinality scaling**: performance at 100k, 1M, 10M active series
- **Out-of-order ingestion**: handling late-arriving data
- **HA failover time**: replica promotion or catchup delay
- **Long-term query**: performance querying months/years of historical data
- **Resource usage**: CPU and memory per million samples ingested
- **TSBS benchmark**: Time Series Benchmark Suite (standardized workloads)

## 6.4 Architecture Patterns

### Lucene Segments
- Each shard is a Lucene index: collection of immutable segments
- Segment: self-contained inverted index + stored fields + doc values + term vectors
- New documents: buffered in memory → flushed as new segment
- Segments are immutable; deletes marked as tombstones; actual removal on merge

### Near-Real-Time Search
- Refresh: make newly indexed docs searchable (default: every 1 second)
- Refresh creates new Lucene segment from in-memory buffer (no fsync yet)
- Flush/commit: fsync segments to disk for durability (default: every 30 min or translog size)
- Translog: per-shard write-ahead log for crash recovery between flushes

### Shard Routing
- Index = N primary shards + R replica shards
- Document → shard: `shard = hash(routing) % num_primary_shards`
- Query: coordinating node fans out to all shards → merge results
- Custom routing: co-locate related documents on same shard

### Distributed Aggregation
- Scatter: each shard computes local aggregation
- Gather: coordinating node merges shard-level aggregation results
- For terms aggs: `shard_size` controls per-shard bucket count for accuracy
- Pipeline aggs: computed only on coordinating node after gather

### Merge Policies
- Tiered Merge Policy (default): group segments by size tier; merge within tiers
- Log Byte Size: merge when total segment size exceeds threshold
- Force Merge: manual merge to N segments (optimize for read-heavy indices)
- Merge impacts: I/O spike during merge; throttled by `max_merge_at_once`, `max_merged_segment`

## 6.5 Memory Management
- **Heap**: JVM heap for field data cache, query cache, indexing buffers; typically 50% RAM (max ~31GB for compressed oops)
- **Off-heap**: Lucene segments memory-mapped; OS page cache critical
- **Field data cache**: loaded on first aggregation/sort on text field; can be huge
- **Doc values**: columnar on-disk format for aggs/sort (default for most fields); minimal heap
- **Query cache**: LRU cache of filter results (bitsets); 10% of heap default
- **Request cache**: shard-level cache of aggregation results; invalidated on refresh
- **Indexing buffer**: 10% of heap default; controls segment flush frequency
- **Rule of thumb**: 50% RAM to JVM heap (≤31GB), 50% to OS for page cache

## 6.6 Testing Criteria
- **Indexing throughput**: documents/sec (bulk API, varying document sizes)
- **Search latency**: P50/P99 for term, phrase, fuzzy, bool queries
- **Aggregation latency**: terms, histogram, nested aggs on varying cardinality
- **Relevance quality**: nDCG, MAP scores against labeled test set
- **Autocomplete latency**: P99 for prefix completion queries
- **Index size on disk**: compression ratio vs raw JSON
- **Refresh impact**: search latency degradation during heavy indexing
- **Merge impact**: I/O and latency during segment merges
- **Cluster scaling**: linear throughput increase with added nodes
- **Rally benchmark**: official Elasticsearch benchmarking tool with standard tracks
